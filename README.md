# My NixOS System Configuration

Welcome to my NixOS system configuration repository! This repository contains the declarative configuration of my NixOS system, showcasing the unique features and benefits of this Linux distribution.

## About NixOS

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a powerful and unique Linux distribution known for its innovative package management system and declarative configuration approach. Here are some key reasons why NixOS is perfect for certain use cases:

- **Declarative Configuration:** NixOS uses a declarative configuration model, allowing you to specify the desired state of your system in a configuration file. This makes it easy to version control your system configuration and reproduce it on different machines.

- **Atomic Upgrades and Rollbacks:** NixOS enables atomic system upgrades and rollbacks, ensuring system stability. If an upgrade causes issues, you can easily revert to a previous configuration.

- **Immutable System:** System-wide configurations are discouraged, and instead, you define your system's configuration in a Nix expression. This leads to a more predictable and reproducible system.

- **Functional Package Management:** Nix employs functional programming principles, isolating packages and their dependencies. This reduces dependency conflicts and simplifies software management.

- **Package Reproducibility:** Nix ensures that packages are built deterministically, enabling reproducible builds for system stability and security.

- **Customization and Extensibility:** NixOS offers extensive customization. You can create custom packages, modify existing ones, and define unique system configurations to suit your needs.

- **Rolling Release Model:** NixOS follows a rolling release model, allowing continuous updates without the need for reinstallations.
